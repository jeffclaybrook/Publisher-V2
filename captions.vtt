Today video is considered an essential part
of communications by most organizations, and

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.380
while there are many delivery options available,
like YouTube or webinar platforms, they often

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.580
fall short of providing the full solution.
You're counting on video to provide an effective

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.130
message but find your platform is too complex,
has limited interactivity, no built-in resources,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.449
and suffers from video bandwidth issues. Today
users high expectations for online content

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:38.120
requires cost-effective solutions that are
flexible and easy to use. Our cloud applications

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.120
solve these problems. Combining the video with
synchronized and embedded content played through

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.430
customized multimedia channels gives you a
true interactive experience. Oh, and it eliminates

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.619
those buffering issues regardless of bandwidth.
Now take a look to my left. The first thing

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:01.440
you'll notice that while we provide video
with synchronized slides we have added layers

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.080
and capabilities that totally expand the impact
of your content. Here's an example of an auxilary

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.550
media that opens as part of the show then
returns back to the primary video. Or it can

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.360
be opened by clicking on a hotspot. Go ahead,
pause the video and click on the learn more

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.440
button. We've included each of these components
for a reason. The changes in technology and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.410
viewing habits show us that to keep an audience
and maximize attention you need to give them

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.659
an interactive experience. How many times have
you watched a video but had to go elsewhere

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.190
to get more details and information? Our platform
keeps the audience and users engaged gives

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.409
them the ability to explore all the resources
or media without ever leaving your program.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.710
This dramatically increases the effectiveness
and viewers retention of your message or your

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.890
information. The corresponding slides, well
those are often the show stealer. In addition

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.610
to the information that follows along with
the video, the slides a launch pad for embedded

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.610
links of any type of supporting content, from
information on a website to details on your

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.060
product serve or message. For example, you can
include anything that can be linked from an

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.620
online source and of course specific information
from your organization. All of this information

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.310
is accessed to connect links we call hotspots.
Go ahead, click where it says learn more to

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.280
see how other information can be added to
your show or course. Want to engage your viewers

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.180
even more? Use that auxilary media as a response
tool for questions included in your content.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.069
Another feature of this platform is its real-time
polling and feedback capability. That appears

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.180
in the bottom panel below this video and the
resource panel directly below the video allows

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.170
you to include any information you want to
be downloadable to the viewer. All of these

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.160
features, true multimedia, hotspots, interactive
questions, tracked questions, polls, they all

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.459
work together to make your show rise above
